_This course is written for individuals who:_   

- Are comfortable with GitHub and know how to make a pull request  
- Wish to save time and enhance their scientific projects using  automation
- Perhaps previously tried to learn about GitHub Actions but felt overwhelmed on how to get started

## Prerequisites 

This course builds on concepts introduced in the [Reproducibility](https://jhudatascience.org/Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics/introduction.html) and [Advanced Reproducibility](https://jhudatascience.org/Adv_Reproducibility_in_Cancer_Informatics/introduction.html) courses from the ITCR Training Network. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub and/or do not have an account, we'd suggest you start with those courses by using the links.
